_“Maybe there’s no one who’s perfect, but who wants to be anyway?”_  
— Takeshi Hosomi

Hi, I’m Julianne! I’m a highly-motivated IT professional with an interest in software engineering.

By day, I help educators and researchers practice their crafts by providing effective infrastructure and timely support. By night, I’m an independent developer attempting to hone her skills through practice and implementation.

When I’m not writing code, you can find me playing the guitar, performing game-master duties for tabletop role-playing games, or tending to my [digital garden](https://wiki.julianneadams.dev).
