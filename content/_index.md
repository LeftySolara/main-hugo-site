## Hi, I'm Jules 👋🏽

I like to make software that's easy and enjoyable to use!

I’m an IT professional, hobbyist programmer, and dedicated cat mom. I enjoy playing games, building mechanical keyboards, playing music, growing my [digital garden](https://wiki.julianneadams.dev), and maintaining my homelab.

This is my website and blog, where I chronicle my thoughts and opinions as I navigate through this wonderful thing called life.

If you’re interested in me or my work, feel free to [reach out](https://links.julianneadams.dev). I’m always happy to meet new people!

To see what I’m working on now, visit [this page](https://julianneadams.dev/now).
