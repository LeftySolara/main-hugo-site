## Hi, I'm Jules 👋🏽

I’m a highly-motivated IT Professional with an interest in software engineering.
By day, I provide support for users in the higher education sector.
By night, I'm a hobbyist programmer who dreams of
creating things that are useful to others.

This is my website and blog. Here I chronicle my thoughts on a wide range of topics
including computing, mental health, and productivity.

If you are interested in my blog posts, check out a list of them [here](https://julianneadams.dev/posts).

I also maintain a [digital garden](https://wiki.julianneadams.dev), which is updated
much more frequently and covers many more topics than my blog.

If you would like to get in touch, feel free to send me an email at [julianne@julianneadams.dev](mailto:julianne@julianneadams.dev).
I am also available on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/julianneadams/), [GitHub](https://github.com/LeftySolara), and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/leftysolara).
