title: "Now"

_Last updated September 26, 2024_

This page is where I list the things that I'm focusing on now.

People often ask me what I'm up to. I usually have a hard time giving an accurate answer because I'm often trying to do too much at once. So, I created this page as a reminder to myself and a way to keep me focused. Whenever I feel like I'm unfocused or trying to do too much, I refer to this page to get myself back on track.

This is a public declaration of priorities. It also helps me [say "no"](https://sive.rs/no2). When I decline invitations, I point people to this page to let them know it's not personal.

This Now Page was inspired by [Derek Sivers](https://sive.rs/nowff). If a Now Page is something that interests you, why not [join the movement](https://nownownow.com/about) and create one for yourself?

## What I'm Doing Now

- Working as an IT professional in the education sector
- Improving my knowledge of web development
- Growing my [digital garden](https://wiki.julianneadams.dev)
- Enjoying being a GM for a Pathfinder 2e group
