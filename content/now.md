title: "Now"

_Last updated January 20, 2024_

This page is where I list the things that I'm focusing on now.

People often ask me what I'm up to. I usually have a hard time giving an accurate answer because I'm often trying to do too much at once. So, I created this page as a reminder to myself and a way to keep me focused. Whenever I feel like I'm unfocused or trying to do too much, I refer to this page to get myself back on track.

This is a public declaration of priorities. It also helps me [say "no"](https://sive.rs/no2). When I decline invitations, I point people to this page to let them know it's not personal.

This Now Page was inspired by [Derek Sivers](https://sive.rs/nowff). If a Now Page is something that interests you, why not [join the movement](https://nownownow.com/about) and create one for yourself?

## What I'm Doing Now

### Studying for the CCNA Exam

In an attempt to advance my career in IT, I am currently studying for the [Cisco Certified Network Associate (CCNA)](https://learningnetwork.cisco.com/s/ccna) exam. My hope is to earn the certification and increase my chances of becoming a network engineer.

### Deepening My Knowledge of C Programming

I've been writing code in C for a while now, though I feel that my knowledge is lacking. That's why I'm currently reading [Modern C](https://www.manning.com/books/modern-c) and will also be going through [Beej's Gude to C Programming](https://beej.us/guide/bgc/). While going through these books, I'll also be working on my own personal programming projects.

### Growing My Digital Garden

I have a [digital garden](https://wiki.julianneadams.dev) where I keep most of the knowledge I've obtained recently. I'm hoping to grow it to be a useful resource not only for myself, but for others as well.

### Playing Fun Games

Right now I'm playing the following games:

- Final Fantasy XIV
- Cities: Skylines II
- Baldur's Gate 3
- Pathfinder: Kingmaker
